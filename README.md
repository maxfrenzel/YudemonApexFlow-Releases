# Yudemon ApexFlow - Desktop App

**ApexFlow** is a racing analytics platform that combines heart rate variability (HRV) data with sim (and in the future also real) racing telemetry to help you understand how stress and focus affect your performance on track.

This desktop app automates the data collection process for iRacing sessions.

## What It Does

- Connects to your Polar H10 or other Bluetooth HR sensor
- Records heart rate and RR intervals during your racing session
- Automatically detects iRacing telemetry files (.ibt)
- Uploads everything to your ApexFlow dashboard with one click

## Download

Download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/maxfrenzel/YudemonApexFlow-Releases/releases) page.

- **Windows**: `Yudemon-ApexFlow-Windows-x.x.x-Setup.exe`

## Installation (Windows)
