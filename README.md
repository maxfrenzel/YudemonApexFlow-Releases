# Yudemon ApexFlow - Desktop App

**ApexFlow** is a racing analytics platform that combines heart rate variability (HRV) data with sim racing telemetry to help you understand how stress and focus affect your performance on track.

This desktop app automates the data collection process for iRacing sessions.

## What It Does

- Connects to your Polar H10 (or other Bluetooth HR sensor)
- Records heart rate and RR intervals during your racing session
- Automatically detects iRacing telemetry files (.ibt)
- Uploads everything to your ApexFlow dashboard with one click

## Download

Download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/maxfrenzel/YudemonApexFlow-Releases/releases) page.

- **Windows**: `Yudemon-ApexFlow-Windows-x.x.x-Setup.exe`

## Installation (Windows)

Since the app isn't code-signed yet, Windows may show security warnings. This is normal for new/independent software.

**When downloading (browser warning):**
- Edge/Chrome may warn the file "isn't commonly downloaded"
- Click the **"..."** or **"^"** menu → **"Keep"** or **"Keep anyway"**

**When running (SmartScreen warning):**
- If you see "Windows protected your PC"
- Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**

After installation, the app will auto-update when new versions are released.

> **A note on trust:** At the end of the day, until I have code-signing set up for the app, you're being asked to trust some stranger on the internet that this software is safe. So that you at least know who that stranger is: You can find my personal website at [maxfrenzel.com](https://maxfrenzel.com) and you can also check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-frenzel-ph-d-60597361/).
